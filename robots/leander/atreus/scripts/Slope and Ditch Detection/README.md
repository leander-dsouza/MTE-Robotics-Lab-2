# Project Description:

This package was created in reference to this [research paper](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/js/2013/643815/). It describes a
method on how to obtain slope angle and ditch depth without the use of image processing by using a panel made up of 4 sonar sensors.

This project implements a custom-based URDF to aid the said above. The working of this project credits to the research paper mentioned.
Follow the below tutorials to implement the same:

## Tutorial:

* Launch **atreus**:
      
      roslaunch atreus slope_ditch_feasibility.launch

* Run the driving node:

      rosrun atreus key_drive.py
      
* Finally run the object feasibility script:

      rosrun atreus ultrasonic_object_feasibility.py 

* Note that the models are available in the world launched for slope and ditch feasibility. Model names:- *Ramp* and *Ditch*
